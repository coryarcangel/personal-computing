## Overview

In this workshop, we will be examining and creating contemporary art that is made to be experienced on/over personal computing devices such as computers and cell phones.

Since the 1980's artist's have been making art which is meant to be experienced over networks. This expanding field is (generally) called net art.

The great thing about this type of art is many works can be experienced through a web browser at home, or on a cell phone, or in a class room. Taking advantage of this accessibility, we will be looking at seminal examples of net art from the last 30 years. And again, as a reminder, we will not be looking at photocopies, or slides, or installation shots, but the actual works themselves live and in our browsers!

We will be working towards an informal, and private online exhibition on ... Friday the last day of the workshop!. 

The workshop is organised as a crash course in all things related to anything I can think of in making online work, and putting together an online exhibition. It's going to be fast paced, a bit un-focused, and I'll try to cram as much information in as I can in the 5 days. Don't worry if you miss something, because we will keeping track of everyting on the social network Are.na - which will be a big part of the class. We will start with the basics and focus on a framework to discuss the seemingly simple question - what is contemporary art? And working from there we will dive into contemporary art and all it's online permutations, with a healthy dose of fringe experiences regarding our digital daily lives.

A few notes on COVID. Although it seems we are meeting IRL, if we do need to switch to remote, this would be an opportunity which seems very timely given the workshop is about art to be experienced at a distance.
