<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In this workshop, we will be examining and creating contemporary art that is made to be experienced on/over personal computing devices such as computers and cell phones.</p>

<p>Since the 1980’s artist’s have been making art which is meant to be experienced over networks. This expanding field is (generally) called net art.</p>

<p>The great thing about this type of art is many works can be experienced through a web browser at home, or on a cell phone, or in a class room. Taking advantage of this accessibility, we will be looking at seminal examples of net art from the last 30 years. And again, as a reminder, we will not be looking at photocopies, or slides, or installation shots, but the actual works themselves live and in our browsers!</p>

<p>We will be working towards an informal, and private online exhibition on … Friday the last day of the workshop!.</p>

<p>The workshop is organised as a crash course in all things related to anything I can think of in making online work, and putting together an online exhibition. It’s going to be fast paced, a bit un-focused, and I’ll try to cram as much information in as I can in the 5 days. Don’t worry if you miss something, because we will keeping track of everyting on the social network Are.na - which will be a big part of the class. We will start with the basics and focusing on a framework to discuss the seemingly simple question - what is contemporary art? and working from there we will dive into contemporary art and all it’s online permutations, with a healthy dose of fringe experiences regarding our digital daily lives.</p>

<p>A few notes on COVID. I realize this might seem a disappointment to not meet IRL, but I thought of this as an opportunity which seems very timely given the workshop is about art to be experience at a distance. So, in keeping with those thoughts, I have re-worked the workshop to take advantage of things which are not IRL based. Yah!</p>
