# Personal Computing
---
## Overview

In this course, we will be examining and creating contemporary art that is made to be experienced on/over personal computing devices such as computers and cell phones.

Since the 1980's artist's have been making art which is meant to be experienced over networks. This expanding field is (generally) called net art.

The great thing about this type of art is many works can be experienced through a web browser at home, or on a cell phone, or in a class room. Taking advantage of this accessibility, we will be looking at seminal examples of net art from the last 30 years. And again, as a reminder, we will not be looking at photocopies, or slides, or installation shots, but the actual works themselves live and in our browsers!

Example works we will examine are One Terabyte of Kilobyte age, by Olia Lialina & Dragan Espenschied, Documenta Done, by Vuk Cosic, VVEBCAM by Petra Cortright, and Art Thoughtz, by Jayson Musson.

At the same time we will be discussing and thinking about two parellel lines of thought. One is contemporary art and its definition: What is contemporary art? What makes something contemporary art? Is contemporary art a form of show-business? And the other line of thought is our daily digital lives: How do we spend our digital lives? What is something like Youtube, or Facebook? Where are the edges and points of friction in different online systems?

For the last part of the workshop we will work to combine our knowledge of net art, contemporary art, and the new contexts available to us in todays online world to create something of our own.
