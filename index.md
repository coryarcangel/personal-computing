# Personal Computing

## Overview

In this workshop, we will be examining and creating contemporary art that is made to be experienced on/over personal computing devices such as computers and cell phones.

Since the 1980's artist's have been making art which is meant to be experienced over networks. This expanding field is (generally) called net art.

The great thing about this type of art is many works can be experienced through a web browser at home, or on a cell phone, or in a class room. Taking advantage of this accessibility, we will be looking at seminal examples of net art from the last 30 years. And again, as a reminder, we will not be looking at photocopies, or slides, or installation shots, but the actual works themselves live and in our browsers!

We will be working towards an informal, and private online exhibition on ... Friday the last day of the workshop!. 

The workshop is organised as a crash course in all things related to putting together an online exhibition. We will start with the basics and focusing on a framework to discuss the seemingly simple question - what is contemporary art? and working from there we will dive into contemporary art and all it's online permutations, with a healthy dose of fringe experiences regarding our digital daily lives - how do we spend our digital lives? What is something like Youtube, or Facebook? Where are the edges and points of friction in these different online systems?

A few notes on COVID. I realize this might seem a disappointment to not meet IRL, but I thought of this as an opportunity which seems very timely given the workshop is about art to be experience at a distance. So, in keeping with those thoughts, I have re-worked the workshop to take advantage of things which are not IRL based. Yah!
